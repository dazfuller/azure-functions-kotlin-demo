# Azure Functions in Kotlin Demo

This is an Azure Functions demo project created in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
to demonstrate how the two can work together. It also reads and writes to
[Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/tables/) with
the Microsoft Java library. It has 2 functions with defined routes providing
GET and POST operations on fictional assets to record and read log messages.

The first post about this is available over at the [Elastacloud Channels](https://www.channels.elastacloud.com/channels/software-engineering/kotlin-and-azure-functions-part-1)
page.

I'm still learning Kotlin myself so things will change in the code base.
